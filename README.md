Hawk provides a web interface for High Availability clusters managed
by the Pacemaker cluster resource manager. The current goal of the
project is to provide a complete management interface to the HA
cluster, both in the form of a flexible REST API as well as a modern
client frontend using the API.

### Puma server configuration

You can change the configurations of both instances of the Puma sever through
the configuration file in `hawk/config/puma.rb`. You can also pass options directly
through environment variables.

Please also note that the Puma server is configured to use a maximum number of
16 threads withing one worker in clustered mode. This application is thread safe
and you can customize this through the puma.rb file. 

For further information about threads and workers in Puma, please take a look at
this great article by Heroku: [Puma web server article](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-rails-applications-with-the-puma-web-server)

### Hacking hawk tools

Hawk's tools are the programs under the `hawk/tools` folder
(`hawk_chkpwd` and `hawk_invoke`). 

```bash
ls /usr/sbin/hawk_* -l+ +
-rwsr-x--- 1 root haclient 9884 2011-04-14 22:56 /usr/sbin/hawk_chkpwd+
-rwsr-x--- 1 root haclient 9928 2011-04-14 22:56 /usr/sbin/hawk_invoke+
```

`hawk_chkpwd` is almost identical to `unix2_chkpwd`, except it restricts
acccess to users in the `haclient` group, and doesn't inject any delay
when invoked by the `hacluster` user (which is the user the Hawk web
server instance runs as).

`hawk_invoke` allows the `hacluster` user to run a small assortment
of Pacemaker CLI tools as another user in order to support Pacemaker's
ACL feature. It is used by Hawk when performing various management
tasks.
